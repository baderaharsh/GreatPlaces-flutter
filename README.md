Step 1 - Built basic structure of the application.

Step 2 - Imported the packages: path (to get the basename of the captured image), path_provider (to get the directory of local files of the application on the device), provider, image_picker(to use native device feature - Camera), sqflite(to store data in device storage using SQL).

Step 3 - Using image_picker, path & path-provide dependencies, implemented the logic to capture and store the image locally.

Step 4 - Using sqflite dependency, implemented the logic to create database; insert & retrieve the data from the database.
